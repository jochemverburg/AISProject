# AISProject
This is the repo to collaborate on the BriteLite case of AIS

For the first assignment we decided that everyone first looks at a part and also tries to work on the report already. For the first assignment we decided for the following sub-division:
João and Jochem will work on:
•	A product architecture: which products and services does BriteLite offer, and how are they delivered?
•	A process architecture: which processes are in place, and how do they relate? This should be tied directly to the organization structure
•	Insight in organization structure

Arif and Quan will work on:
•	Application architecture: what does the current IT landscape look like, and how does it support business?
•	Information architecture: what type of information is used by the business, and where is this information stored
•	 Infrastructure architecture: what does the infrastructure architecture look like, and how does it support IT?

Afterwards we will all try to combine these parts to this:
•	An overall diagram which management tends to call “context diagram”. This diagram shows a high-level, 10.000 foot overview of the architecture of BriteLite. No further details on this are supplied
