Group 1: 
Their Infrastructure Architecture is larger than ours
Made assumptions about provided external services for certain applications (e.g. VPN)
Changes they think are useful:
- Also wants one large F&A department
- IT Architecture, lots of single points of failures, no redundancy, maybe can be improved

Group 2:
Difficult to model inventory -> both staff-department and part of distribution center
One large box for outsourcing actors, this box is used by BriteLite company -> can also be a co-ordination process
High-level products
Production triggers quality control but flows to resellers
Have a lot of interfaces and connections: only a few applications -> In future: all connections have to be modelled if you want one large system
Have grouped data: 1. Production 2. Distribution 3. CRM & Sales 4. Consultancy -> some packages use from both areas
Infrastructure, not clear where the data is. 

Quality of Czech Republic products is lower -> is this a problem? What is  the impact if part of the products is of lower quality?
Data view: There should be matching data in the other layers (e.g. business) -> data in the application data comes from customer, should be related to some other object in the business layer.

Group 3:
Remarks by Martin:
- You can use extra notations if necessary
- Decisions made has an historical background -> so decide if it's still the right choice
- Does HQ make a difference? -> changing can have an impact (like Philips)
When model certain things like lan-connection: if you need it for proposed changes (if the change could affect it)

General remarks:
- Level of detail dependent on where some problems might be, use the amount of detail needed to show where problems are and needed to make decisions about changes
- Mention group on report
